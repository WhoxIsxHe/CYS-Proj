# Details about each component

## SIEM Deployment

**Azure Sentinel**: The SIEM solution collects, analyzes, and responds to security data from multiple sources. The deployment includes:

- **Data Connectors**: Integrates logs from various sources such as Azure services, Office 365, and custom data sources.
- **Incident Response**: Configures automated response workflows using Azure Logic Apps.

## Threat Intelligence

**Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Sets up feeds to receive IOCs directly, providing real-time updates on malicious IPs, domains, and file hashes.

- **Automation**: Implements workflows to ingest and analyze threat intelligence data.
- **Alerts**: Configures alerts for immediate notification of potential threats.

## Network Segmentation

**Juniper EX2200-C**: Sets up network segmentation to improve security and manage traffic more effectively.

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

**Snort**: Uses Snort to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities.

## VPN Configuration

**OpenVPN**: Configures and tests VPNs for secure remote access.

## Firewall Rules

**Firewall Configuration**: Develops and tests complex firewall rules to protect the network from various threats.

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

**Traffic Control**: Implements ACLs to control traffic flow and enhance security.

## Network Monitoring

**Juniper Tools**: Uses Juniper's tools to monitor network performance and detect anomalies.

## Security Policies

**Policy Development**: Develops and enforces security policies across the network.

## SIEM Integration

**Integration with Juniper**: Integrates Juniper routers with a SIEM system to centralize security monitoring.

## Deauthentication Attack Simulation

**Flipper Zero**: Simulates a deauthentication attack using Flipper Zero to understand potential vulnerabilities and test network defenses.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to deploy and manage a SOC using Microsoft Azure and Juniper EX2200-C switch. By integrating a SIEM system, setting up a threat intelligence feed, implementing network segmentation, and using advanced security tools, I can effectively monitor, detect, and respond to security threats in real-time. The addition of a deauthentication attack simulation using Flipper Zero highlights my practical skills in identifying and mitigating potential network vulnerabilities.
